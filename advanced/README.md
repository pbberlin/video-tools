# Workflow

## Raw editing with LosslessCut

* `01-aa-preprocess`... for frame-by-frame cutting in LosslessCut

    * Resulting file can only be played with VLC, any _editing_  
      for instance with KDEnlive results in broken sync + audio drift.  
      Even streaming-recording does not solve this.

    * `Davinci Resolve` keeps the audio sync while re-encoding.
